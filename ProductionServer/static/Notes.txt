Versatile document ordering system:

- Unordered list element on side bar, contains all active analyses (CHECK)
- List items can be re-ordered intuitively through drag and drop actions (CHECK)
- TeX document (and subsequently, PDF) adapts to order (CHECK)
	- Individual TeX templates for each analysis, stored locally (CHECK)
	- Templates populated and consolidated into finished TeX file (or compiled server-side) (CHECK)
- "Add paragraph" option (CHECK)
	- Adds large (<textarea>?) field to make a paragraph (CHECK)
	- Field for heading (subsection in TeX), omitted if left blank ("Leave blank for no subheading") (CHECK)
	- Adds paragraph to sorting list (CHECK)
	- Iterative: can support multiple paragraphs, numbered or otherwise identified. (CHECK)
	- Automatically added to TeX file, under whatever section the item is below in sorting list (top=intro) (CHECK)
	- Checkbox option to add paragraph to the top of section it's under (immediately under the section heading) (CHECK)
- Conclusion section support? (CHECK)
- Edit title, date, preparer/checker/approver functionality (CHECK)


- Upload company logo for title page? (For premium? Do later.)


Ideas:

- Replace checkboxes with buttons to add analyses, allowing for multiple iterations of a single analysis
