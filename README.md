App and website for the NAS multi-analysis tool.

This is the development branch.
The latest two commits contain a highly unstable "overhaul" of the website. It is not finished, as it's requirements are beyond the scope of the current developer. It seeks to change all checkboxes for the analyses into "+/-" buttons, to support an arbitrary amount of any given analysis. 
The way the website is currently written critically breaks-down with these changes, and therefore requires an almost complete overhaul of every major system implemented.
The latest two commits have begun this process, but the further I get, the more I realize that I cannot hope to complete all that work in the time I have.
Consider this my resignation from this project, I leave it to the next developer to implement (fix) this complete overhaul. 
Nova Aerospace Structures has my documentation for the current website and it's systems, which will surely be necessary to navigate the "spaghetti code" of the website.
